    <p><ul>Background:<ul> Goku was born on Planet Vegeta, named Kakarot.
      He was the son of the Saiyan Bardock, and was sent to Earth due to Frieza destroying Planet Vegeta.
      His mission was to destroy it, but he was dropped on his head and forgot it, when being adopted by Grandpa Gohan, not to be confused with Goku's son, Gohan.
      When he became an adult, and married his wife Chi Chi, and had previously mentioned Gohan, the Saiyan Raditz who was Goku's brother came to Earth.
      Together, Goku and Piccolo defeated Raditz, but Goku was killed by the attack.
      Many years later after the Saiyan Saga, on Namek during a battle with Frieza, Goku became the first Super Saiyan.</p>
